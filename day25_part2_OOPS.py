#1 Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
    # Q= Square root of [(2*C*D)/H]
    # Following are the fixed values of C and H:
    # C is 50. H is 30.
    # D is the variable whose values should be input to your program.

import math

numbers = input("Please enter the value of D: ")
numbers = numbers.split(',')

result = []
for D in numbers:
    Q = round(math.sqrt(2 * 50 * int(D) / 30))
    result.append(Q)

print(result)


#2 Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have an area function which can print the area of the shape where Shapeâ€™s area is 0 by default.

#6 Write a Person class with an instance variable, , and a constructor that takes an integer, , as a parameter. The constructor must assign  to  after confirming the argument passed as  is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as , the constructor should set  to  and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
# yearPasses() should increase the  instance variable by .
# amIOld()  should perform the following conditional actions:
# If , print You are young..
# If  and , print You are a teenager..
# Otherwise, print You are old..	
# Sample Input:
# 4
# -1
# 10
# 16
# 18
# Sample Output:
# Age is not valid, setting age to 0.
# You are young.
# You are young.
 
# You are young.
# You are a teenager.
 
# You are a teenager.
